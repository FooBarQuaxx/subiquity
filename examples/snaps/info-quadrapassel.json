When you form a complete horizontal row of blocks, the row will\ndisappear and you score points. The game is over when the blocks get stacked\ntoo high. As your score gets higher, you level up and the blocks fall faster.\n\nIf you're looking for a challenge, Quadrapassel allows you to increase the\ninitial speed of the blocks, or begin the game with partial blocks on some\nof the rows. Or, instead of allowing the blocks to fall randomly, it can\nselect blocks that will be hard for you to place.","download-size":1867776,"icon":"https://dashboard.snapcraft.io/site_media/appmedia/2017/07/quadrapassel.svg.png","name":"quadrapassel","developer":"canonical","status":"available","type":"app","version":"3.22.0","channel":"beta","ignore-validation":false,"revision":"39","confinement":"strict","private":false,"devmode":false,"jailmode":false,"contact":"","license":"GPL-3.0+","screenshots":[{"url":"https://dashboard.snapcraft.io/site_media/appmedia/2017/07/Screenshot_from_2017-07-17_14-20-21.png"}],"channels":{"latest/candidate":{"revision":"39","confinement":"strict","version":"3.22.0","channel":"candidate","epoch":"0","size":1867776},"latest/edge":{"revision":"31","confinement":"strict","version":"3.22.0","channel":"edge","epoch":"0","size":1593344},"latest/stable":{"revision":"39","confinement":"strict","version":"3.22.0","channel":"stable","epoch":"0","size":1867776}},"tracks":["latest"]}],"sources":["store"],"suggested-currency":"USD"}
